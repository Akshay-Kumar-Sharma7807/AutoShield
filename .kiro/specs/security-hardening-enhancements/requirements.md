### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want container and Kubernetes security hardening, so that I can secure containerized workloads and orchestration platforms according to industry best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN container scanning is performed THEN the system SHALL assess Docker daemon configuration, container runtime security, and image vulnerabilities

3. WHEN container compliance is checked THEN the system SHALL validate against NIST Container Security guidelines and Docker Bench for Security
4. WHEN orchestration security is configured THEN the system SHALL harden etcd, API server, kubelet, and controller manager configurations
5. IF container runtime is not supported THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on supported container platforms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want automated compliance mapping to multiple frameworks simultaneously, so that I can demonstrate adherence to SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and other regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compliance assessment runs THEN the system SHALL map security controls to SOC 2 Type II, PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and GDPR requirements
2. WHEN compliance reports are generated THEN the system SHALL produce framework-specific reports with evidence collection and gap analysis
3. WHEN audit trails are created THEN the system SHALL maintain immutable logs with digital signatures for regulatory compliance
4. WHEN compliance scoring is calculated THEN the system SHALL provide weighted scoring based on control criticality and business impact
5. IF compliance data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL identify missing evidence and provide remediation guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want real-time monitoring and drift detection, so that I can identify when systems deviate from approved security baselines and respond immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor security configurations and detect unauthorized changes
2. WHEN drift is detected THEN the system SHALL send real-time alerts via email, SIEM integration, or webhook notifications
3. WHEN baseline comparison occurs THEN the system SHALL identify configuration changes with before/after analysis and risk assessment
4. WHEN auto-remediation is configured THEN the system SHALL automatically restore approved configurations based on policy rules
5. IF monitoring service fails THEN the system SHALL maintain local monitoring capabilities and queue alerts for delivery

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want network security hardening and vulnerability assessment integration, so that I can secure network configurations and correlate hardening with vulnerability scan results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network hardening is applied THEN the system SHALL configure advanced firewall rules, intrusion detection systems, and network segmentation
2. WHEN vulnerability integration is enabled THEN the system SHALL import scan results from Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys to prioritize hardening efforts
3. WHEN network assessment runs THEN the system SHALL evaluate network device configurations including switches, routers, and wireless access points
4. WHEN threat intelligence is integrated THEN the system SHALL apply IOC-based hardening rules and threat-informed security configurations
5. IF network devices are inaccessible THEN the system SHALL provide configuration templates and manual implementation guidance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevSecOps engineer, I want CI/CD pipeline integration and Infrastructure as Code support, so that I can embed security hardening into automated deployment workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI/CD integration is configured THEN the system SHALL integrate with Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, and GitHub Actions
2. WHEN IaC scanning is performed THEN the system SHALL analyze Terraform, CloudFormation, and Ansible playbooks for security misconfigurations
3. WHEN pipeline hardening runs THEN the system SHALL apply security controls during deployment and validate configurations post-deployment
4. WHEN security gates are implemented THEN the system SHALL block deployments that fail security compliance checks
5. IF pipeline integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide standalone validation tools and manual verification procedures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security architect, I want advanced threat modeling and risk-based hardening, so that I can prioritize security controls based on threat landscape and business risk assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN threat modeling is performed THEN the system SHALL analyze attack vectors, threat actors, and potential impact to prioritize hardening controls
2. WHEN risk assessment is conducted THEN the system SHALL calculate risk scores based on vulnerability severity, exploitability, and business impact
3. WHEN adaptive hardening is applied THEN the system SHALL adjust security controls based on threat intelligence feeds and risk tolerance
4. WHEN security metrics are generated THEN the system SHALL provide risk reduction measurements and ROI calculations for security investments
5. IF threat intelligence is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use static risk models and provide guidance on threat intelligence integration
