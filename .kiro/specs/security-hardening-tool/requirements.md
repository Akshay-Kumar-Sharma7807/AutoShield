# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing an automated, cross-platform security hardening tool that addresses the critical need for consistent, auditable, and reversible security configurations across Windows and Linux operating systems. The tool will automate the application of industry-standard security baselines, generate comprehensive compliance reports, and provide rollback capabilities to ensure system administrators can maintain secure environments efficiently and reliably.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to automatically detect the target operating system and apply appropriate security hardening configurations, so that I can ensure consistent security baselines across heterogeneous environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is executed THEN the system SHALL automatically detect whether the target OS is Windows (10/11), Ubuntu (20.04+), or CentOS (7+)
2. WHEN the OS is detected THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate hardening module for that specific OS version
3. IF the OS is not supported THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit gracefully
4. WHEN OS detection completes THEN the system SHALL log the detected OS version and architecture

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to apply configurable hardening levels with specific parameters, so that I can customize security enforcement based on organizational requirements and risk tolerance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring hardening THEN the system SHALL support three hardening levels: basic, moderate, and strict
2. WHEN Windows OS is detected THEN the system SHALL apply parameters from Annexure-A including Account Policies (password policy, account lockout), Local Policies (user rights assignment), Security Options (accounts, interactive logon, network security), System Settings (UAC, system services), Windows Defender Firewall, Advanced Audit Policy Configuration, and Microsoft Defender Application Guard settings
3. WHEN Linux OS is detected THEN the system SHALL apply parameters from Annexure-B including Filesystem configuration (kernel modules, partitions), Package Management (bootloader, process hardening, warning banners), Services (server/client services, time sync, job schedulers), Network configuration (devices, kernel modules/parameters), Host Based Firewall, Access Control (SSH, privilege escalation, PAM), User Accounts and Environment, Logging and Auditing (system logging, auditd), and System Maintenance (file permissions, user/group settings)
4. WHEN a hardening level is selected THEN the system SHALL display which parameters will be modified before execution
5. IF custom parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL validate them against supported configuration options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want detailed reports showing before/after states of all security configurations, so that I can verify compliance and audit security changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hardening is applied THEN the system SHALL capture the previous value/state of each parameter
2. WHEN hardening completes THEN the system SHALL record the current value/state of each parameter
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL indicate success or failure status for each parameter change
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL export them in PDF format with severity ratings
5. WHEN any action is performed THEN the system SHALL log it with timestamps for audit trails

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want both CLI and GUI interfaces available, so that I can use the tool in automated scripts or interactive sessions based on my workflow needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using CLI mode THEN the system SHALL support all core functionality through command-line arguments
2. WHEN using CLI mode THEN the system SHALL provide scriptable output formats for automation
3. WHEN GUI is available THEN the system SHALL provide an intuitive interface for novice administrators
4. WHEN either interface is used THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent functionality and output
5. IF GUI dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to CLI mode gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to rollback security configurations to previous states, so that I can quickly recover from hardening changes that cause operational issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hardening is applied THEN the system SHALL automatically store previous configurations in a secure backup format
2. WHEN rollback is requested THEN the system SHALL restore all modified parameters to their previous values
3. WHEN rollback completes THEN the system SHALL generate a rollback report showing restored configurations
4. WHEN multiple hardening sessions exist THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific backup points for rollback
5. IF backup data is corrupted or missing THEN the system SHALL warn the user and prevent incomplete rollbacks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the tool to perform comprehensive security checks and remediation, so that I can ensure all critical security vulnerabilities are addressed systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security checks run THEN the system SHALL evaluate all parameters defined in Annexure-A (for Windows: 150+ specific settings across account policies, local policies, security options, system settings, firewall, audit policies, and application guard) and Annexure-B (for Linux: 200+ specific settings across filesystem, package management, services, network, firewall, access control, user accounts, logging/auditing, and system maintenance)
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity (critical, high, medium, low) based on security impact and compliance requirements
3. WHEN remediation is applied THEN the system SHALL verify that changes were successfully implemented by re-checking the modified settings
4. WHEN checks complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of total issues found and resolved across all security categories
5. IF remediation fails for any parameter THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and continue with remaining items

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an IT operations manager, I want comprehensive logging and audit capabilities, so that I can track all security changes and maintain compliance documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation is performed THEN the system SHALL log the action with precise timestamps
2. WHEN logging occurs THEN the system SHALL include user context, target system details, and operation results
3. WHEN logs are created THEN the system SHALL store them in a tamper-evident format
4. WHEN log rotation is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain historical logs according to configurable retention policies
5. IF logging fails THEN the system SHALL alert the administrator and optionally halt operations based on configuration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a compliance auditor, I want the tool to implement all specific security parameters from industry standards, so that I can ensure complete coverage of security hardening requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Windows hardening is performed THEN the system SHALL implement all 26 system services configurations, 22 Windows Defender Firewall settings, 15 Advanced Audit Policy configurations, and 5 Microsoft Defender Application Guard settings as specified in Annexure-A
2. WHEN Linux hardening is performed THEN the system SHALL implement all filesystem kernel module restrictions, partition configurations with security options (nodev, nosuid, noexec), service disabling/configuration, network security parameters, SSH hardening (20+ specific settings), PAM configuration, and comprehensive audit rules as specified in Annexure-B
3. WHEN parameter validation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify each setting meets the exact specification (e.g., password history ≥24, password length ≥12, account lockout duration ≥15 minutes)
4. WHEN hardening levels are applied THEN the system SHALL map each parameter to appropriate levels (basic: critical settings, moderate: recommended settings, strict: all settings)
5. IF any required parameter cannot be applied THEN the system SHALL document the limitation and suggest manual intervention

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tool to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can troubleshoot issues and ensure reliable operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
2. WHEN insufficient privileges are detected THEN the system SHALL prompt for elevation or provide guidance
3. WHEN network connectivity is required THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts and connection failures gracefully
4. WHEN system resources are insufficient THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest remediation steps
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt to restore system state and log the incident
